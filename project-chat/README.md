# University Chatbox

This project implements a chatbot for the University of Poppleton, designed to assist users with queries about the university, such as coffee bar timings, library hours, admissions, sports facilities, and more. The chatbot is interactive, user-friendly, and includes advanced features like session resume, random disconnection, and follow-up suggestions.



## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interact with the chatbot by simply typing your queries.
- **Configurable Responses**: The chatbot uses a `responses.json` file for easy customization of answers.
- **Follow-Up Questions**: Provides suggestions for follow-up queries based on the context of the conversation.
- **Random Disconnection**: Simulates real-life interruptions with a 3% chance of random disconnection or after every 5 user inputs.
- **Session Resume**: Allows users to review or resume their previous session seamlessly.
- **Logging**: Saves all conversations in a `chat_log.txt` file for review or debugging.



## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
